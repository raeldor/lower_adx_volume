# lower_adx_volume
This is some rudimentary code to lower the volume on ADX files.  I wrote this to lower the volume on music in Persona 3 FES because I felt it was overpowering the voice sound level.  This code keeps the original file sizes, so there are no problems with LBAs when re-integrating into the ISO.
